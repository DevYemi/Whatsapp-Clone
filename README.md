# Project Title

This is a WhatsApp Web Clone that was created with React (FrontEnd) and Firebase (Backend).

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/DevYemi/Whatsapp-Clone
```

Go to the project root directory

```bash
  cd WHATSAPP-CLONE-MASTER
```

Install dependencies

```bash

Then for the backend you will need to create a Firebase Account with your Google mail account and Add a new Project, after creating the new project you will need to copy the newly created project config

After copying the config, open the src dir in the root dir then open the backend dir and create a "firebase.js" file there. Paste the copied API keys into "firebaseConfig" const and save the file. Your firebase.js file must look exactly like the one displayed in the image attached below.
